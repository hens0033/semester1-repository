            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Allie Henseler, I was born in Ottawa, Canada on the 28<sup>th</sup> of May 2001. I currently live in Barrhaven with my parents due to the pandemic. However, I would like to move out and rent an apartment close to Algonquin College, so I won’t have to travel far. I graduated from <abbr title="John McCrae Secondary School">JMSS</abbr> here in Barrhaven in 2019 and took a year off from any education.</p>
            <p>I’m studying at Algonquin College for Interactive Media and Design. I’m hoping to graduate with a 3.0 average after two years. The class I’m most interested in has to be Graphic Design. I have loved working in photoshop and illustrator during my high school career. I have always enjoyed logos, brandings, and even artwork that was done in photoshop and illustrator and I look forward to learning the tools.</p>
